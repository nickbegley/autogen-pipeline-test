  - Include horizontal line for actual Ï€
  - Save plot as PNG file
- Testing Requirements:
  - Verify plot components (axes, labels, lines)
  - Test image file generation
  - Validate data representation accuracy
- Risk Factors:
  - Matplotlib compatibility issues
  - File system permissions for saving plot

## Execution Flow

1. Tasks T1, C1, and C2 can be executed in parallel
2. Task C3 must wait for Task C2 completion
3. For each computational task (C1-C3):
   - Worker agent must implement solution in Python
   - Create comprehensive unit tests
   - Validate results against success criteria
   - Generate documentation including:
     - Implementation approach
     - Test coverage report
     - Performance metrics
     - Any assumptions or limitations

## Validation Requirements

1. All code must follow PEP 8 style guidelines
2. Unit tests must achieve minimum 90% coverage
3. Documentation must include:
   - Function/class docstrings
   - Type hints
   - Usage examples
4. Performance metrics must be reported for computational tasks
5. All dependencies must be clearly specified
